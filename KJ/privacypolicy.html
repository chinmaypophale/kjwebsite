store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the
personal information you give us such as your name, address and email

<p><strong>CONSENT</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you provide us with personal
information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an
 order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you
consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we ask for your personal

you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an
opportunity to say no.</span></p>

payments. We/Instamojo do not store your card data on their servers. The

standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard,

extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to
us.</span></p>

providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the
information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related
 transactions.</span></p>

that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
 which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, remember that certain
providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a
different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed
 with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are
located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you leave our store’s website or
 are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of
Service. </span></p>

privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy
 statements.</span></p>
